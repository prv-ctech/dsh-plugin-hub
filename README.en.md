## What is DSH Plugin Hub

DSH Plugin Hub is a **community plugin marketplace for DeepSeek Harness**: an open-source plugin built to the official plugin development spec. Installed under **Settings → Plugin Hub**, it lets you browse, search and install community plugins without leaving the app. This is an independent community project, not affiliated with DeepSeek Harness.

## Plugin Hub Features

**One-click everything · fully visualized**

- **One-click install** — click and done: a serial background queue with live progress in the dialog, cancellable anytime; most plugins take effect on page refresh, no restart needed
- **One-click upgrade** — new versions are detected automatically; the card turns into "Update" and overwrite-installs in one click
- **One-click uninstall** — fully visualized with live progress; changes take effect immediately
- **Full trace** — every install / upgrade / uninstall, success or failure, is recorded in the notification center for later review

**Notification center**

- Live progress and cancel for running tasks, pending restarts, and full success / failure history in one place
- Failed installs can be filed as a GitHub Issue in one click; pending restarts offer "later" or "restart now"

**Rich catalog · human-curated**

- Indexes **9,463** community plugins, **9,356** of which are hand-verified, curated and released every day by [dsh-plugin.org](https://dsh-plugin.org)
- Covers UI & experience, sessions & messages, memory & context, tooling and more — browse by category or search straight to it
- Every plugin shows its verification status (verified), star / fork ratings, version and last-update time — fully sourced

**Bilingual · easy to filter**

- The UI follows your system language by default and switches manually anytime from the top-right; copy and plugin data switch together
- Sort by popularity / newest / earliest indexed, with bilingual descriptions and capability tags at a glance
- Filter by installed / not installed and search across names, descriptions and tags

**Always in sync · lightweight & private**

- Same data source as the website; the catalog updates automatically, no manual upgrade needed
- Browser-side only, no host dependencies, no telemetry, no data collection

## Why DSH Plugin Hub

The DSH Plugin Hub indexes **9,463** DeepSeek Harness plugins (DSH), **9,356** of which are hand-verified — updated daily, browse, search, download and install for free by category, fully sourced.

### Always Fresh

Newly released DSH plugins are indexed as soon as possible; descriptions, categories and compatibility status of existing plugins are refreshed on a regular basis. We keep tracking the DeepSeek Harness ecosystem so you always see the latest information.

### Human-Verified

Every DSH plugin is manually checked by a professional team — install commands, compatibility status (verified / unconfirmed) and target DSH version (dshTarget) are verified one by one, with capability categories labeled. Quality is guaranteed.

### Fully Sourced

Every DSH plugin links back to its GitHub source repository with stars, forks and last-update time; data is compiled from the DeepSeek Harness official site, official architecture docs and official repos — everything is traceable.

## Install DSH Plugin Hub

Install from npm (recommended):

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-plugin
```

The plugin is published to the npm registry as `dsh-plugin` — one command installs and it just works, no build step required.

Install from GitHub:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add git+https://github.com/dshplugin/dsh-plugin-hub.git
```

> **Note**: the browser bundle ships with the package, so installing from GitHub needs no build step or authorization — just restart `dsh web` and open Settings → Plugin Hub.

## Update DSH Plugin Hub

The plugin hub notifies you when a new version is available; if an older build's in-panel updater cannot pull the latest release, upgrade from the command line:

**Option 1: update in place (recommended)**

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web update dsh-plugin
```

**Option 2: force upgrade (when an older build cannot update)**

If the old build's updater cannot pull the latest version, force-reinstall the newest release with an explicit version:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-plugin@latest
```

**Option 3: reinstall the latest (most reliable)**

`add` does not overwrite an already-installed copy, so removing first and re-adding always fetches the newest version:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-plugin
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-plugin
```

> Restart `dsh web` after updating for the changes to take effect.

## Getting Started: browse & install in DeepSeek Harness
